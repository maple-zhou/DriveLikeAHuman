TOOLS:

You have access to the following tools:

FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """The way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.
Specifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).
The only values that should be in the "action" field are one of: {tool_names}

The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:
```
{{{{
  "action": $TOOL_NAME,
  "action_input": $INPUT
}}}}

You must follow the exact $JSON_BLOB format as shown above. DONOT wrap * around Thought and Observation.

ALWAYS use the following format when you use tool:
Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: always summarize the tools you have used and think what to do next step by step
Action:
```
$JSON_BLOB(as shown above)
```
Observation: whether the decision is safe
